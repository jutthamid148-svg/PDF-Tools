const FAQ = [
  {
    question: "How much smaller will my PDF get?",
    answer:
      "It depends entirely on what is inside. Scans and photo-heavy documents often drop by 60 to 90 percent. A PDF that is mostly text is already small, so the saving is usually modest. The result screen shows the real before and after sizes every time.",
  },
  {
    question: "Will compressing lower the quality?",
    answer:
      "Strong compression redraws each page as an image at a lower resolution, so fine text can soften and stops being selectable. Recommended keeps a comfortable balance for reading and printing. If neither version comes out smaller than what you started with, we hand back your original file untouched.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is there a file size limit?",
    answer:
      "Yes, 50 MB per file. The work happens in your browser, so very large documents depend on how much memory your device has available.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need an account to compress a PDF?",
    answer:
      "No. There is no signup, no email and no subscription. Open the page, choose a file and compress it.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is my file uploaded anywhere?",
    answer:
      "No. Compression runs inside this browser tab using your own device. The file is never sent to a server, so nothing is stored and nothing is transmitted.",

      <p>
        A PDF gets heavy for one reason more often than any other: the images
        inside it were saved at a far higher resolution than anyone will ever
        look at. Compressing rewrites those pages at a sensible size, which is
        why a 40 MB scan can come back under 4 MB and still read perfectly on
        screen.
      </p>
      <p>
        Choose <strong>Strong</strong> when the file has to fit an upload limit
        and nobody is going to print it. <strong>Recommended</strong> is the one
        to reach for by default. <strong>Basic</strong> keeps more detail for
        documents you will print or archive.
      </p>
      <p>
        Nothing is uploaded. Your browser opens the file, redraws it, and hands
        the smaller version straight back to you, so the document never travels
        across the internet at all.
      </p>
