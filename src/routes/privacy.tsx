      <Block title="Your files are not uploaded">
        <p>
          Every tool on this site runs inside your own web browser, using your
          device's own processor and memory. When you choose a PDF or an image,
          the browser reads it locally. For non-AI PDF tools, the original file
          is not transmitted to us or stored on our servers.
        </p>
        <p>
          The finished document lives in your browser's memory until you close or
          reload the tab. There is no server copy of the original file to store,
          delete, or retain.
        </p>
      </Block>

      <Block title="AI tools and extracted text">
        <p>
          When you choose an AI tool, text extracted from your PDF is sent to our
          server-side AI endpoint to generate the requested response. The
          original PDF remains in your browser, but the extracted text is
          processed by our AI provider for that request. Do not use an AI tool
          with information you are not permitted to share with an AI service.
        </p>
        <p>
          AI responses can be incomplete or incorrect. We do not use uploaded
          documents or extracted text to build a user profile, and we do not
          store document text in this site's application storage.
        </p>
      </Block>

      <Block title="What this means in practice">
        <Bullets
          items={[
            "For regular PDF tools, we cannot read your document contents because the original file stays in your browser.",
            "We do not know the names of your files.",
            "AI tools send extracted text to the AI service only when you explicitly run an AI action.",
            `The ${MAX_FILE_LABEL} limit exists because the work happens on your device, not because of a storage quota.`,
            "Closing the tab removes the processed file from memory.",
          ]}
        />

      <Block title="What we do collect">
        <p>
          We collect anonymous usage measurements so we know which tools are
          worth improving. These are counts of actions, not contents. For
          example: a tool page was opened, a file was selected, processing
          started, processing finished, processing failed, a download was
          clicked.
        </p>
        <p>
          These events include the name of the tool and basic technical details
          such as file count and size. They do not include filenames, file
          contents, page text, email addresses, or anything extracted from your
          documents. Analytics events are sent only after you choose to allow
          analytics in the consent notice.
        </p>
      </Block>

      <Block title="Cookies and local storage">
        <p>
          We store small preferences in your browser for theme and consent
          choices. If you allow analytics, an anonymous consent preference lets
          us measure tool usage. No advertising tracking cookies are used by the
          site.
        </p>
      </Block>

      <Block title="Accounts">
        <p>
          The tools on this site do not require an account. We do not ask for
          your email address, your phone number, or a password, so there is no
          account record to secure, export, or delete.
        </p>
      </Block>

      <Block title="Children">
        <p>
          These tools are general-purpose utilities and are not directed at
          children. We do not knowingly collect personal information from
          anyone, of any age, because we do not collect personal information at
          all.
        </p>
      </Block>

      <Block title="Changes to this policy">
        <p>
          If how the site works changes, this page changes with it, and the date
          at the top is updated. We will not quietly start uploading files and
          leave this page as it is.
