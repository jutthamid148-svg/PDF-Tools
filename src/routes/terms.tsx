      <Block title="Using the tools">
        <p>
          The tools on this site are free to use for personal and commercial
          work. No account is required. You keep every right you already had in
          the documents you process, and we gain none of them.
        </p>
      </Block>

      <Block title="Your files are your responsibility">
        <p>
          Because processing happens on your device, we never see your files and
          cannot recover them. Keep your original. Download your result before
          closing the tab, because the processed file is held in browser memory
          and is gone once the tab closes.
        </p>
      </Block>

      <Block title="Fair use">

            "Do not use these tools on documents you have no right to modify.",
            `Files are limited to ${MAX_FILE_LABEL} each, and very large documents also depend on your device's available memory.`,
            "Do not attempt to disrupt the site or the experience of other people using it.",

      <Block title="No warranty">
        <p>
          The tools are provided as they are, without warranty of any kind. PDF
          is a large and inconsistent format, and some files, particularly
          damaged ones, unusual exports and password protected documents, will
          not process correctly. Check every result before you rely on it.

          To the extent the law allows, we are not liable for any loss arising
          from the use of this site, including lost or altered documents.

      </Block>

      <Block title="Availability and changes">
        <p>
          Tools may be added, changed or withdrawn. We may update these terms;
          the date at the top of this page shows when they last changed.
